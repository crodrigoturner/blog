There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did.

Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea? God bless! Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.

Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain. The fear of death arises from the belief that in death, there is awareness.

Sooner or later in life everyone discovers that perfect happiness is unrealizable, but there are few who pause to consider the antithesis: that perfect unhappiness is equally unattainable.

Nadie se ha convertido en pobre por dar a los demás.  
<span class="author">Anne Frank</span>


Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.  
<span class="author">Dalai Lama</span>

The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed.  
<span class="author">William Gibson</span>

El desempleo se debe en parte a la falta de ingresos (fundamentalmente un problema de distribución), pero también se trata de una falta de autoestima y estatus social.  
<span class="author">Nick Bostrom</span>

We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.  
<span class="author">Buckminster Fuller</span>

If you want to make a living flower, you don't build it physically cell by cell. You grow it from the seed.

<span class="author">Christopher Alexander</span>

<span class="author">Hunter S. Thompson</span>


Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.   
<span class="author">Albert Einstein</span>


Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.  
<span class="author">Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov</span>


When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.   
<span class="author">Dr. Theodore Woodward</span>


The problem with today’s world is that everyone believes they have the right to express their opinion AND have others listen to it.
The correct statement of individual rights is that everyone has the right to an opinion, but crucially, that opinion can be roundly ignored and even made fun of, particularly if it is demonstrably nonsense!
<span class="author">Brian Cox</span>


No code has fewer bugs than no code.  
<span class="author">Kevlin Henney</span>

<span class="author">Eleanor Roosevelt</span>

We are not nouns, we are verbs. I am not a thing…an actor, a writer…I am a person who does things…I write, I act…and I never know what I’m going to do next. I think you can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun.  
<span class="author">Stephen Fry</span>

A powerful algorithm for happiness is to be wealthy but anonymous.  
<span class="author">Scott Galloway</span>


Socially, we’re told, “Go work out. Go look good.” That’s a multi-player competitive game. Other people can see if I’m doing a good job or not. We’re told, “Go make money. Go buy a big house.” Again, external monkey-player competitive game. When it comes to learn to be happy, train yourself to be happy, completely internal, no external progress, no external validation, 100% you’re competing against yourself, single-player game.   
<span class="author">Naval Ravikant</span>

<span class="author">Paulo Coelho, Warrior of the Light</span>  



Many people fear nothing more terribly than to take a position which stands out sharply and clearly from the prevailing opinion. The tendency of most is to adopt a view that is so ambiguous that it will include everything and so popular that it will include everybody. Not a few men who cherish lofty and noble ideas hide them under a bushel for fear of being called different.
<span class="author">Martin Luther King, Jr., Strength to Love</span>  



Good timber does not grow with ease:
The stronger wind, the stronger trees;
The further sky, the greater length;
The more the storm, the more the strength.
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
In trees and men good timbers grow.  
<span class="author">Douglas Malloch</span>

Let's use the web to help people understand each other.

Zen has no goal, it is traveling without point, with nowhere to go. To travel is to be alive, but to arrive is to be dead. A world which focuses on destinations, which only cares about getting somewhere as fast as possible, becomes a world without substance.

Only dead fish go with the flow.
