#### Work values

My philosophy and values at work are the following:

##### Win/win/win    
I always aim to find a win for the customer, a win for the company, and a win for myself.   
##### Solutions    
I find solutions, I fix problems.   
##### Communicate early and often    
My stakeholders and collaborators should know what’s going on continuously.   
##### Nothing is “not my job”     
If I see a pressing problem, I gather context and fix it.

#### How I work

I believe everyone should state how to work and share it with co-workers and stakeholders.

1. Email is the best way to contact me. Chat, slack... just gets lost. I try to funnel all my inputs to my various emails accounts.
2. I work M-F, 09.30-17.30. <em>(Sometimes more, if needed).</em>
3. If you need anything from me, please clearly let me know <strong>what is needed and when.</strong>
4. I prefer meetings after 10 am, and before 16 pm.
5. My time zone is GMT+2.(Madrid, Spain)
