#### Work values

My philosophy and values at work are the following:

**Win/win/win** I always aim to find a win for the customer, a win for the company, and a win for myself.   
**Solutions** I find solutions, I fix problems.   
**Communicate early and often** My stakeholders and collaborators should know what’s going on continuously.   
**Nothing is “not my job”** If I see a pressing problem, I gather context and fix it.
