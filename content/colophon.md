### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to:   
1. learn publicly (some of my writing may be raw or unfinished)
2. share with others (some of my writing may be interesting, other may be very boring)
3. claim, care and own my bit of the internet. This is my website, [*there are many like it, but this one is mine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed).
4. be a member of a cool group (people with a personal site)
5. present myself, my thoughts and work in my own terms
