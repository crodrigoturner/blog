While listening to the <a href="https://www.takeoverpod.com/">How to Take Over the World</a> episode of Rasputin, one of the plugs was for another similar podcast that delves into fictional biographies, it's called <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jameson-olsen1">Becoming the main character</a>. 

Both podcasts, synthesize books on real or fictional characters, to find the hows and whys people became great.

This led me to think about why I read biographies (mainly audiobook format), such as Teddy Roosevelt's, Churchill's, Napoleon's,  Hawkings's, Feynman's, Von Neumann's and Gordon Brown's...

I concluded that I look for alternatives that have not crossed my mind and special ingredients that these people may have that took them to a higher level in history.

We are all made of the same stuff, we all have the same 24 hours/day and roughly the same 30000 days/life, though some people achieve greatness, as per historical standards, and others just whiz by without a trace...

Please listen to these podcasts, I am currently listening to <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jameson-olsen1/episodes/Dune-Part-1--Pain-Is-A-Beginning-e2kp0f6">the Paul Atreides episode</a> which is very interesting.
