## Key people on AI 

Several key figures have significantly contributed to the field of artificial intelligence. Here are some of them:

1. Alan Turing: Considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, Turing developed the concept of the Turing machine, which laid the theoretical foundation for modern computing. He also proposed the famous "Turing Test" to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.

2. John McCarthy: Coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1956 and organized the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a field of study. McCarthy made numerous contributions to AI, including the development of the LISP programming language and the creation of the AI Lab at Stanford University.

3. Marvin Minsky: A pioneer in the field of AI, Minsky co-founded the MIT AI Lab and made significant contributions to the study of neural networks, robotics, and cognitive psychology. He also co-authored the influential book "Perceptrons," which explored the limitations of early neural network models.

4. Geoffrey Hinton: Known as the "Godfather of Deep Learning," Hinton is a leading researcher in artificial neural networks and deep learning. His work on backpropagation and the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has had a profound impact on the field of AI, particularly in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.

5. Yoshua Bengio: Another prominent figure in deep learning, Bengio is known for his contributions to the development of deep neural networks and the advancement of unsupervised learning techniques. He co-authored the seminal paper on deep learning with Hinton and Yann LeCun, which helped spark renewed interest in neural networks in the early 2000s.

6. Yann LeCun: Renowned for his work on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), LeCun has made significant contributions to the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning. He is currently the Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and the Silver Professor of Computer Science at NYU.

7. Herbert Simon: A Nobel laureate in economics and a pioneer in the field of AI, Simon conducted groundbreaking research on problem-solving and decision-making processes, laying the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence.

These are just a few of the key figures in the field of artificial intelligence, and there are many others who have made important contributions to its development and advancement.
