Oubaitori (桜梅桃李) is a Japanese idiom that translates to "cherry, plum, peach, and apricot".    
It symbolizes the idea that everyone blooms and grows at their own unique pace, encouraging self-acceptance and avoiding comparison with others.    
It is a reminder to embrace individuality and celebrate personal growth without comparing oneself to others.    
Here's a more detailed breakdown:   
1. **Four Trees:** The term "oubaitori" is derived from the kanji characters for these four trees, which all bloom at different times in spring, representing the diverse timing of life's journey. 
2. **Meaning:** The idiom signifies that individuals, like these trees, have their own unique timing and should not be compared to others based on their progress or accomplishments. 
3. **Encouragement:** Oubaitori encourages self-acceptance, celebrating individuality, and focusing on personal growth rather than comparing oneself to others.
