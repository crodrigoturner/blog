## Large Language Model

LLM typically stands for "Large Language Model." It refers to AI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) that are capable of understanding and generating human-like text on a large scale. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and more.

The size of Large Language Models (LLMs) can vary, but they typically have hundreds of millions to billions of parameters. For example, models like GPT-3 have 175 billion parameters, while newer models might have even more. These parameters represent the weights and connections within the neural network that enable the model to process and generate text.
