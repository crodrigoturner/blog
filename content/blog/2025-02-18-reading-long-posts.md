excerpt: How I digest "longish" articles
---

My reading list is quite extensive, 600+ articles, some of them will not be read. Ever. Some are not even articles, more like apps or services that I want to try. And others are very interesting but very long articles that I want to read/listen. 

To read the latter kind of articles I use [Elevenreader](https://elevenreader.io/), from Elevenlabs, which turns text into speech in a very smooth, convincing and nice way. This app has allowed me to listen to 40 pages long articles in 90 minutes while walking Pancho.

I highly recommend it, you can choose the voice (even Richard Feynman if you like), the speed... it's very good.
