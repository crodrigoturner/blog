The main purpose of this website/blog is to share what I'm up to, thoughts I'm having, media I'm consuming, and designing and redesigning the site <em>ad nauseam</em>.

In the static pages, you can learn <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/about/">who I am</a>, <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/work/">what I am working on</a> and <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/contact/">how to get in touch</a>. Like in many other personal websites, you'll find a <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/now/">now</a> page and a <a href="/hello">hello</a> page.

In the <a href="/">blog or homepage</a>, the main theme is <a href="https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/">stock and flow</a>. 

Some topics like <a href="/category/ai">AI</a>, the <a href="/category/internet">internet</a>, <a href="/category/parenting">parenting</a>, and my somewhat well-thought-out opinions on current matters... deserve a well-written thorough post. Those posts belong to the "stock" pile and will remain relevant longer. 

Other short updates or reviews belong to the "flow" pile, they will most likely go out of date, days after publication.

There are no tags on this website, just categories, so if you want to try your luck with keywords, please go to the <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/archive/">archive</a>.

Both piles represent who I am at this moment.

Any feedback? Please <a href="https://www.carlosrodrigo.com/contact/">email me</a>.
