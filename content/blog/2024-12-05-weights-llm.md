In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, "weight" refers to the numerical values assigned to the connections between neurons in the model's neural network. These weights determine the strength of the connections and influence how information is processed as it flows through the network. During the training process, the model adjusts these weights based on the input data and the desired output, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data. These learned weights enable the model to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.
