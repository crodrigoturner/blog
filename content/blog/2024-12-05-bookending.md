excerpt: how to start and finish the workday
---

I recently read a <a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/bookending/">post</a> by Mandy Brown about a best practice that she incorporated into her routine. 

She calls it bookending, as in the bookends that open and close the content of a book. 

It is an <abbr title="Standard Operating Procedure">SOP</abbr> that defines a beginning and an end to the work day. It consists of the following steps:

1. At the beginning of your work day, start with a blank sheet of paper or notebook and visualise what the day will look like, before getting into the busyness of emails and notifications. 
2. At the end of the day, close all the apps, shut down the computer, and review the day.

These simple steps limit and define your workday, especially relevant in a remote work environment.

This concept is something I've seen multiple times, though have not yet fully implemented it.
