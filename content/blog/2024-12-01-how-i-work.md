1. Email is the best way to contact me. Chat, slack... just get lost.
2. I work M-F, 09.30-17.30. <em>(Sometimes more, if needed).</em>
3. If you need anything from me, please clearly <strong>let me know what is needed and when.</strong>
4. I prefer meetings after 10 am, and before 16 pm.
5. My time zone is GMT+2.
