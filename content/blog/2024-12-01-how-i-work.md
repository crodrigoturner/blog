excerpt: A short intro into how I prefer to work.
---

I believe everyone should state how to work and share it with co-workers and stakeholders.

1. Email is the best way to contact me. Chat, slack... just get lost. I try to funnel all my inputs to my various emails accounts.
2. I work M-F, 09.30-17.30. <em>(Sometimes more, if needed).</em>
3. If you need anything from me, please clearly let me know <strong>what is needed and when.</strong>
4. I prefer meetings after 10 am, and before 16 pm.
5. My time zone is GMT+2.(Madrid, Spain)
