excerpt: Sometimes, take a pause to go faster, further...

A person is very much like a computer, with a hardware (i.e: body) and a software (i.e: mind).

We can upgrade our hardware by eating better, being active and even and getting prosthetics to improving our abilities. We can also upgrade and improve our software, to achieve this we can keep on learning, adding facts and some could say meditate.

This comparison has led me to believe that sometimes, when things aren’t going as well as they should, a computer must be rebooted. And the same may be true with ourselves, when thing aren’t going great it’s possible that we need to undergo a rebooting process to start fresh.

Nothing too harsh. Just take a few days off, rethink how we do things, evaluate our systems and basically find better ways to go forward.
