<h3>1. Personal</h3>
<p>By day, I solve complex problems with data; by night, I’m a husband and a father to two boys. In between, I’m usually being outsmarted by my Spanish Water Dog Pancho. My mission to shape the life I want.</p>

<p>My interests are data, data driven decision making, AI, webdesign, internet, biomimicry, spreadsheets, EVs, evolution, industrial design, science, history, speeches, philosophy, poetry (wordsmithing), data visualization, space, sci-fi and cooking...  
</p>

<p>I was born at 345.73 ppm CO2</p>

<p>My full name is Carlos Roberto Rodrigo Turner.</p>

<h3 id="professional">2. Professional</h3>
<p>
I'm a data specialist with 7+ years of experience in leveraging data to drive businesses forward. I am passionate about helping make data-driven decisions that lead to growth and success. 
</p>
<p>
I have worked in architecture studios, big energy companies, luxury brands, and small companies. I currently work at <a href="http://tecnicayavance.com">Técnica y Avance</a> My background is intentionally diverse—spanning architecture, energy, luxury brands, and startups—giving me a unique perspective on how data impacts different sectors. Whether I’m optimising back-office operations or resolving intricate inventory issues, I maintain a process-driven approach and a keen eye for detail to ensure every workflow is seamless and results-oriented.</p>
